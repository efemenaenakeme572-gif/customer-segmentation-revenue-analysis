📊 Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis Dashboard

Overview
This project presents an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard developed in Power BI to analyse customer segmentation, revenue distribution, and performance trends.

Key Objectives:
Provide a consolidated view of total revenue, orders, and quantity sold;
Analyse monthly revenue trends to identify seasonality and growth patterns;
Segment customers by revenue contribution;
Assess revenue concentration risk using Top 10 customer analysis;
